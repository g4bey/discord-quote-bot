# discord-quote-bot

This was the bot as I left it in May 2022. There's tons of problems in it, but I decided to write this readme and create a release.
I will try to improve it although I would really not code it the same way as of today.

Back in the days I used a lot of upserts as I thought it could be useful of bot go off-line. 
Though, I believe it would be better to figure a way to detect guilds that are not in db, then register them properly.


This was made a while ago and I guess I wanted to finish it. It's funny looking back at all the weird code.
