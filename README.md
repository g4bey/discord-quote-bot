## Discord Quote Bot

# disclaimer

As of my last update in May 2022, the bot has numerous issues that need addressing. Despite its flaws, I decided to document these problems in a readme file and create a release. While I intend to make improvements, I would prefer not to code it the same way as of today.

In the past, I heavily relied on upserts, thinking they could be useful in case the bot went offline. However, I now believe it would be more effective to find a way to detect guilds that are not in the database and register them properly.

This project was initiated a while ago, and at the time, I was eager to complete it. Looking back, it's amusing to see all the unconventional code I wrote.


## how to start

it's pretty easy! All you need is a token u set in `config.yaml`... and voila! 
You may as well set a owner guild in order to use the owner only commands.
